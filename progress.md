At 16:20, audio pronounces "hundred" as "hun" in the number 261,918. Proposed change: Use phrase "two-hundred and six-one thousand nine hundred and eighteen" in AI script to affirm that it pronounces it correctly. At 17:15, there is a pause between the words in "officers' servants" that makes it sound like "officers, servants," changing the original meaning of the text. Proposed change: make sure there is no comma in the AI script and that "officers'" has the correct apostraphe. At 18:02, pronounces "7,200" as "seven two hundred." Proposed change: write out the number as either "seven thousand two hundred" or "seventy-two hundred." At 18:22, pronunciation of "1,500" is skipped over and sounds like "one thousand- fifteen hundred." Proposed change: Make sure there are no extra numbers in the AI script and write out either "one thousand five hundred" or "fifteen hundred" for the AI to read.
