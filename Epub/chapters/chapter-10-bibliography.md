# Bibliography {.unnumbered}

As the public has not as yet paid very much attention to Negro History, and has not seen a volume dealing primarily with the migration of the race in America, one could hardly expect that there has been compiled a bibliography in this special field. With the exception of what appears in Still's and Siebert's works on the *Underground Railroad* and the records of the meetings of the Quakers promoting this movement, there is little helpful material to be found in single volumes bearing on the antebellum period. Since the Civil War, however, more has been said and written concerning the movements of the Negro population. E.H. Botume's *First Days Among the Contrabands* and John Eaton's *Grant, Lincoln and the Freedmen* cover very well the period of rebellion. This is supplemented by J.C. Knowlton's *Contrabands* in the *University Quarterly*, Volume XXI, page 307, and by Edward L. Pierce's *The Freedmen at Port Royal* in the *Atlantic Monthly*, Volume XII, page 291. The exodus of 1879 is treated by J.B. Runnion in the *Atlantic Monthly*, Volume XLIV, page 222; by Frederick Douglass and Richard T. Greener in the *American Journal of Social Science*, Volume XI, page 1; by F.R. Guernsey in the *International Review*, Volume VII, page 373; by E.L. Godkin in the *Nation*, Volume XXVIII, pages 242 and 386; and by J.C. Hartzell in the *Methodist Quarterly*, Volume XXXIX, page 722. The second volume of George W. Williams's *History of the Negro Race* also contains a short chapter on the exodus of 1879. In Volume XVIII, page 370, of *Public Opinion* there is a discussion of *Negro Emigration and Deportation* as advocated by Bishop H.M. Turner and Senator Morgan of Alabama during the nineties. Professor William O. Scroggs of Louisiana University has in the *Journal of Political Economy*, Volume XXV, page 1034, an article entitled *Interstate Migration of Negro Population*. Mr. Epstein has published a helpful pamphlet, *The Negro Migrant in Pittsburgh*. Most of the material for this work, however, was collected from the various sources mentioned below.
